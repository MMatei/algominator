# Algominator

The (eventual) result of research into Algorithm-Learning Neural Systems.

The base folder contains a set of models, each of which is tested with the same barrage of tasks, that seek to prove the model's worthiness as algorithm-solving machine.

Needless to say, this is very much a work in progress.
